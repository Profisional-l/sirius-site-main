- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for main headlines to establish a modern and futuristic tone.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure high readability across all text, providing a clean and contemporary feel.
- Monospace font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for labels, emphasizing a tech/coding-oriented style.
- Use vector-based icons, clean lines, tech-inspired motifs, and circuit patterns in blue, enhancing the modern tech aesthetic.
- Employ a modular, grid-based layout with clear, centered content blocks to structure content logically and improve readability.
- Maintain section padding of 120-160px, with an inner content container of 1180px to provide ample spacing and focus on content.
